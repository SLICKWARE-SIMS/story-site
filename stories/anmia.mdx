## Anmia

In my time I have seen many things. Small things, big things, and things in between. I have seen normal things, strange things, and things that can be considered both. The strangest thing I have ever seen however is not a thing, but a being. What it was, is, or will be, I do not know truthfully know. It was simultaneously large, medium and small, taking space and lacking it. It spoke, briefly and at length all at once in silence, to give me a task. To deliver a message, a poster, an announcement. As briefly as it had appeared it disappeared. In its place was a cryptic poster with a cryptic message. My datapad chimed and I had received payment for the delivery. My mind, filled with memories of everything and nothing at all, raced. Then I calmed myself. The mail must flow and so it did!
