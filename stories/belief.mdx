## Belief

Once me, my friend Tres, and our mutual scrapping buddy Fergus were on a rental ship coming from off our home colony. We decided, rather Tres did, that it was worth going to a system he had heard of from working down in the salt refineries; it apparently still had a ‘pulse’ with no 10-23 in decades. Going to some uncharted shithole with little to no proof of profit wasn’t something I considered logical, though Tres still had a radio with connection to a solid relay network that reaches the outer rim from an old job out there; argued that ‘he checked himself’. I had no reason to believe him so we argued for a while…until he played back the signal…Fergus’ face contorted at whatever the sound was. He always had a level head on him, needed to as a sawbones lest someone bleed out from wondering which artery to plug; so when he thinks something is a bad idea I usually figure it’s an informed decision. We sat on it…for a few weeks.
	
Then our pays got docked.

This part of space was desolate; far enough from any star that any shape in the void was swallowed by the dark pit. With no light capable of reaching it or the body it orbits, the station was only visible through imaging slickware built into our nav system. It was drifting out of orbit at a violently obtuse angle; a bloated carcass with ruptured ribs and warped fragments of steel clung to it like vestigial spines. We did our thing. The station still had power surprisingly, so the terminals were all functional without much effort, scrape and scrap, standard routine. This place was an observatory into the cavernous deep…frequent logs spanning 32 cycles scanning for signs of life. All audio. Tres calls out mid-survey to have me see something elsewhere. Fergus and I are wide eyed. The room is fully stocked; hoards of data drives, no missing rations, all for the taking. A good day to be wrong.

	The bridge. The best cut of meat. The hydraulics on our breaching jack slam against either side of the door frame before dropping hard onto the floor, the sound somehow makes the silence more deafening as it fades…the crew are all here, corpses, pressed in mass against the observation decks window, smudge marks covering every square inch of space five feet from the floor. Fergus’ face goes white as he diagnoses the bodies…he says it was from malnutrition; all of them. I froze. 

The window is pitch black. Not a single countable star…but Tres stared at it with a face I had never seen…his breath shaky as he walked towards it. He’s despondent as we ask what he’s doing. I check the rows of terminals for what is outside…I see a spherical mass, its orbiting body…something surrounds it, a mass inconceivable swallowing the opposite side. He pushes Fergus away from the window before his bloodshot eyes press against the glass.

…Then the window blinks.
