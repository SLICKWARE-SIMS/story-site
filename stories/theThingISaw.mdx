## The Thing I Saw At Airlock 302

If you're looking for a story
this one's good and this one's gorey
And I swear to all the stars it's fully true.
So come and listen to my tale
and grab a drink as I regale you
of the Thing I saw at airlock 302

I must admit I dragged myself
still reeking of the bottom shelf
to work that day to earn my union fee
and I must've looked so shitty
that the foreman he took pity 
and so he sent me on light duty, Hanger 3

Well my shift had barely started when
In came a guy 'bout 6 foot 10
A Bratva droog that I knew from 'round the bars
I forgot that I owed him money
And he gave a smile so funny 
that I didn't see the punch that showed me stars

I got up to my feet and thought
That I'd give this fella what I'd got
So I laid right in with the shiv that's in my shoe
I drew blood, the thug was pissed
He grabbed my arm and broke my wrist
threw me on my ass in airlock 302

Well I knew right then that I was cooked
Cause he closed the doors shot me a look
Said "see ya pal" as he cycled out the gas
And I must have prayed to every star I know
But I could see it was my time to go
As I started into breathing my last gasp

Well I can't quite say what happened then
But a little voice in my ear said, "Friend,
I'll help you if you'll do me a favor"
then this kind of Odd gelatinous blob
pushed in my mouth and did its job
I could breathe again, thanks to this alien life saver.

Well I looked the droog straight in the eye
his face went pale when I didn't die
He bolted out, never seen him round again
Well I'm sure glad that I survived
I guess I've got this thing inside
But he saved my life so I'm happy to call him friend

That's the End and thanks to you
For hearing my weird story through
Cause I've been breathing that creature out as you breathe in
Just remember when you sleep
you took my friend and he settled deep
You've got your own thing now growin' there within
