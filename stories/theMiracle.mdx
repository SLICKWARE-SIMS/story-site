## Body

Shelms "Little Dook" Dukakis looked at his Papa. He was soft and dead. Nobody wanted to say it, but Little Dook knew. He watched aunties and uncles he didn't know come up in long black coats to kiss his father on the head. Mama said Papa had a lot of siblings. Each one that came by nodded to Little Dook, took his mother's hand, murmured. Even the lady that Papa called Mama was there at the back, wrapped in her scarf, eyes sharper than anything Little Dook had ever seen. 

The Cardinal was not one of Papa's siblings.

"The Church requests the relic, Ma'am," said the Cardinal. "He cannot…go in like that."

"He's not even cold. And you… you vultures!"

"I understand, Mrs. Dukakis, I feel for your… Family, but we must…"

Little Dook squirmed out of his mother's lap and walked over to the synthwood casket beside the Fertimaxxer. Even with all his scars and tattoos, The Old Dook looked at peace. Sleeping, they said. 

"...he went into The Choke for you people…"

Papa used to walk him through the Gardens of Sol and show him where he'd seen the Sheep, what the names of all the flowers were, lift him up to look inside the squirrel nests. 

"...Sol's laws clearly state…"

No more bedtime stories about Beef or Grandpa Moneybags or Ariel or Jenny. Little Dook reached up to touch the vial clasped between his father's fingers. It was full of ashes.

"...this is the Basilica of Saint Eridanus of the Conflagration. Your husband cannot be returned to Sol holding such an important..."

"He saw it! And it changed him. He was gentler after that. He was better. He was in the room. You people…"

Little Dook traced the faded peanut on his father's hand. It was cold, and hard, and not his father. But it was. And it wasn't. 

Papa liked to tell the story about how he went down into The Choke to get his brother. But he never said who Caliban was or why Uncle Ben had gone down there. Just that he was brave and strong and they both made it back. Both of them different. The same. 

Artificial light streamed through stained glass.

"...that's exactly why it must be catalogued. St. Eridanus' ashes are-"

Little Dook looked down. Mama sounded the way she did when Papa came home stinky, only worse. A beetle crawled across the floor. The marble where they stood was slightly charred. 

"...get the hell out of here or so help me I will…"

The beetle flew away, up to the rafters and out of sight. A moment later, another beetle, or maybe the same one, landed on The Old Dook's forehead. 

When they pushed Papa into the machine that sent him back to Sol, a little bit of him was kept in a glass vial, not ashes, but soil.

And the fire of Rue came upon Saint Eridanus and consumed him, and lo he stood among them still.
