## Big Empty

I’ve seen a lot of things in Prospero’s Dream. You can’t run security operations in a station this haphazard, this sprawling, without seeing your fair ration of shit. 

Some things just stick with you though. 

One cycle, early in my time on station. I received orders for checkpoint duty at Terminal Junction A13, a little slice of claustrophobia made up of repurposed airlocks connecting Docking Bay A13 to the much larger Blocks. The Novos liked it clear.

I made it to A13 early. The syncopated beeping of the O2 recyclers was the only noise that greeted me as I reached the primary gate, a small shiver running down my back as I waited for the secondary gate to let me into the junction itself. Early Bratva repairs on this station involved the guy the lowest bidder won’t even talk to, so I didn’t have a lot of faith that the junction wouldn’t decide to throw me into hard vacuum on a whim. 

Fortunately, the primary gate played nice. Less fortunately, I realized I wasn’t alone. 

Sitting by the broad windows of A13 was a small figure, arms tucked around their knees, forehead almost touching the pressure-sealed glass, paying no attention to the loud hissing as the door sealed me in. 

I sighed to myself as I had to remove this stranger, who I could tell even from across the corridor, was emanating a deep sadness as they looked into space. Orders were orders, and I needed A13 clear. 

As I reached for the huddled figure’s shoulder, I was stopped by their voice: the gravel and static of an android.

“Can you see them?”, the android asked me, plaintively. 

“See what?” I asked, gazing into the big empty ahead. 

“One by one. They’re going out. Candles in the flood,” the android lamented, a thin keening whine at the end of each phrase, characteristic of a voxbox due for maintenance. 

I matched the android’s stare out of the thick glass.

One of the stars in distant view winked out. “A trick of the light…” I started, before another one followed suit. Pure darkness remained where the previous pinpricks of light once glinted.

I dropped to one knee next to the android, transfixed as more and more lights vanished; the firmament outside the Dream giving way to a dark I had never experienced before, even with my eyes closed. 

The emptiness of it all was too much to bear. 

Star after star replaced with nothingness. At some point, I think I sat down next to the android in stunned silence, but moments blurred until it was just me and the void. 

I closed my eyes to blink away unbidden tears and opened them to an empty corridor. I checked my commlink and found that an entire shift had passed. 

The android was nowhere to be seen. I refused to look back out the window. 

I try not to go to A13 anymore.
