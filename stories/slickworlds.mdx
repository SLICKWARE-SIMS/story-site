I don't spend time in slickworlds anymore.

I used to. A lot, actually. After almost every shift. It was an easy way to forget I was on the Dream for a few hours. Told myself it was healthier than going to the bar. 

One night I was walking through my favorite sim, this empty beach from Earth. The sunset was this beautiful pink and the sand was so warm beneath my feet. But it was the smell of the ocean that really sold the illusion. It was always the smells that did it for me.

I was halfway up the beach when I saw this girl sitting in the water, the waves just lapping over her body. I figured the guy running my booth must’ve messed up. I always logged in alone. Half the reason I used the slickworlds was to get some peace and quiet. So I walked up to this girl and told her she was in a private room, and that she should leave. I was pretty rude about it and I immediately felt bad, because she turned around and I saw she couldn’t have been older than ten, and she was crying.

She looked up at me with this pained expression on her face and said that she needed help. That she was sick, but that her dad wouldn’t let her die. I’m really awkward with kids. I didn’t know what to do, so I just started apologising, trying to take back what I’d said. In the moment I was so flustered it didn’t even occur to me how strange what she’d said was.

At that point I got this heavy whiff of burnt plastic. The world started to glitch out. For a fraction of a second I was in this huge dark room surrounded by cables. In front of me was this black box, about 5 feet long and 3 feet wide. Just as I was about to reach out to touch it the guy running my booth pulled the plug and ripped me out of the slickworld.

He gave me a few pills to stop the nausea and apologized for taking me out so suddenly. He said there’d been some kind of warning on his terminal and I told him about the glitch I’d seen. Then I asked about the girl in my session and how she was holding up. He just looked at me, confused. “What girl?” He asked. “You were the only one in the shop tonight.” 

Since then, every time I log into a slickworld all I smell is burnt plastic.

These days I stick to the bar.
