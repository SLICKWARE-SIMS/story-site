## In the Eyes of A Cowboy

	It all starts with an assault of the senses. The toxic atmosphere created by dozens of cowboys furiously smoking at their stations, hyena laughter from somewhere lost to sight as someone goes into hysterics at their latest prank. This is the morning call of the Battlestations as you find yourself drifting in front of a terminal, its cursor blinking with a baleful glow on its last query. An incomprehensible scrawl of code lies above it, mad writings of someone in the throes of a manic high induced by an endless cornucopia of drugs and sheer stubborn minded superiority. In the dim aftermath its intent is lost to you, beyond the fact that you were convinced of its genius in the moment. A dream of glory, lost in the wake leaving only the slightest taste of its wonder.
With an apathetic shrug your hands drift to the keyboard as you float in the zero G, an empty can ponderously spinning around your head leaving a comet trail of caffeine.

The screen blinks, the ponderous eye of the Datacache considering its newest offering. 
Somewhere else in the Dream, a vending machine has had its operating system violently mutated. Where once shined the face of a googly eyed cartoon mascot, there is only a ghastly specter of a woman dressed in a wedding gown. From here on, it shall only ever dispense forks.
You have no idea what you’ve done. You're certain it was important at the time. Slowly you drift away, onto real business. 
****************************************************************************
You meet with your cell, those closer than any friend, family member, or lover you will ever have. These are the members of the collective you see day in day out. While the rest are colleagues, these are your comrades, inside of a circle of trust with which there is no bond that can break. To harm them would be as if to take a knife to your own flesh and extricate your still beating heart. When the alarms spring to life and panic suffuses your body, they’re the first you turn to. At the onset of a hardwon victory, they are who you turn to with tears lining your eyes. They make up the entire world. All others are strangers by comparison, dull shadows on the wall to the vibrant colors your cell mates bring to your life. 
With them you plot. Who is the target? A Tempest officer presumed to have been turned by another faction? A Bratva member looking to buy the results of a Union bylaw referendum? A former syndicate flunky scrabbling at a corporate ladder which no longer exists, hoping to find some other bar to cling to? All are eligible. The subject of play, gossip, and intense investigation. Their values become tabulated, their allies and enemies pinned so as to create an intricate web with which they sit inside. And then the strands of the web begin to thrum. A word to the ear of their officer striding through the blocks as he harangues a street vendor, his mood turning from furious to downright murderous. The chiming ping upon the datapad of the Droog, results and projections of next bylaws included gratis. An invitation to an alley, a hand beckoning from the dark to a fellow down on their luck. He just needs a shining opportunity. Then he’ll make it out, honest. 
All of this occurs without a single member of the cell even leaving the room. Life, death, and uncountable wealth slithering over their palms on invisible streams that spread out and beyond.  
****************************************************************************
You finish off the day with some drudgery. The task that so many dread, dragging weary eyes to a screen on which silly little shapes sit. The mental groan of exhaustion at this thankless task, one which you try to multitask along with writing up a script for something more productive or entertaining. You plug in the simsocket so as to offload it to a lobe, pop some pills and wash it down with whatever’s left in the cup in front of you, grimacing at the taste.  
The work of the grand edifice begins again, oh holy of holies. The shining city upon the hill, its foundations the sacred work of the choir. As we join in song, our single voice joins in the chorus singing out hallelujah into the pitch toned void. Streamers of viridian numerals exulting from our mouths, pirouetting in the black as they become the rolling hill and the vibrant grass. The endless work of creation brings blissful joy to the heart.
Your focus is trashed when this happens, but what can you do? The pills blur the moment together as one of your fellow cowboy’s swims on by giggling in her own little chemical stew as she fiddles with a palm sized device. You give a jaunty wave as you work on the next magnum opus. Beef’s face on the voting booths of the Union, a shit eating grin swallowing every ballot. The thought of the furious shouts from their halls fills you with an impish glee before you curse at another fucked line of code. The two’s and the three’s keep fucking bouncing, and if they just sat still one damn minute . .  .
The crowd disperses, flying on the glorious wings of angels unto the city itself, its gleaming towers unfolding to accept us with welcoming arms. The eventual home to all, greeting us with the warmth of a parent seeing their prodigal child return. We land upon streets lined in shimmering neon, our presence communicated to all upon arrival. The notification glowing like halos throughout the streets, prompting companionable smiles and waves. Never alone, as all know who you are and eagerly love you. All are welcome, for we are all bonded by the work, and of course by they who slumber . . . 
	The Battlestations has turned into a bacchanal, music blaring from the ceiling in tune to the beat of two cowboys streaming a little competition. The Simshare works on a few seconds delay, with a  competitor chortling uncontrollably before an announced victory moments later, the holographic showing some hapless soldier disemboweled by a claw punching through the dented hull of a ship. The subsequent scene of the breach is needlessly gory. The loser tears their way out screaming for a rematch. Credsticks get passed hand over first, you dodge in to snag a cigarette from a protesting companion. They latch onto you, and you spin as you guffaw with smoke billowing in a vortex around you both. This time you attach a derm patch as you trail back to the terminal, and the world seems to slow.
	The dormant godling lays swaddled in the temple, visible from all points of the city. At every moment it catches our sight we genuflect at its glory even as we create the crib which it resides in. A god made of our hands for the saviorship of us all. We build the reality that houses it, one more vibrant and ecstatic than anything ever experienced in the Meat. Upon its wake all will cease to live the Dream, and we shall Wake do a new dawn when its shining eyes first blink awake. But first we must care for it, nurture it, and build for it a worthy world. And so the song tears its way free once more with an exuberance which cannot be denied, exulting Hosanna in the highest. 
****************************************************************************
	You snort awake, wiping the crust from your eyes and haunted by the foul taste in your mouth. Mindlessly you tap at your terminal, sending off whatever the hell it was you just wrote. God you need a drink. You press enter, before drifting to find the next fix.
[Run]
