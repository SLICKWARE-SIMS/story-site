## Earworm

Nothing can get stuck in your head and refuse to leave like a good earworm. Okay, sure, actual earworms can, I guess, but you can get those taken care of at any half-rate block-Doc’.


I know, never plug in a datastick that’s just handed to you, but I’ve got a locked down terminal, and do you know how many artists I'd discovered because they did that outside a concert? Especially at the shows where it looks like they just smashed a wall to have a place to play. Stinkfeeb, O2 Tax Fraud, wormwormworm, you're not finding them on the corporate feeds.


So yeah, my fault, I get it. But please, hear me out. You listen to the stick, just like you've listened to a dozen before. Unique stuff. You whistle it, at least, as much as there's a melody to whistle. Walk by a dingy storefront, and you hear it crackling over their speakers. Hell yeah, sick place, toss ‘em a few creds rather than the vending machine.


And then you hear it lying in bed. Get up, check to see you didn't leave it playing, and it's off by the time you get there. Glitch or something.


You wake up, you hear it. Well, no, you're just thinking about it. Isn't that kinda what hearing is? If you think about your mom's voice, you "hear" it. Right?



Your boss opens his mouth, and the song spills out.


Turn on the shower, and the music pours over you right alongside the water.


You go to one of those Solarian groves, and the fucking LEAVES on the tree rustle the notes out, relentlessly, in a thousand part round.


You go into a Slickworld. That's a real big mistake. The color green shouldn't HAVE A SOUND. Food SHOULDN'T SMELL LIKE MUSIC. THE BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS SHOULDN'T ECHO INSIDE YOU AT TEMPO.



Of course the venue's gone. It's a ramen bar now. They say they've been there two years. They really don't like it when you try and force your way into the storeroom, even though you KNOW that's where it happened and they JUST won't LISTEN. JUST LISTEN TO ME.


What other option do you have? If the Ice Box can store and transfer your whole memory, they've gotta be able to wipe some. Targeted strike. So what if you lose a couple extra days, weeks...months? Heck, doesn't even cost as many creds as you thought. It's worth it.


You think.


But the second you wake up and realize, it's gone, thank Sol, it's gone it's gone it's finally gone,

(what's gone?  ? ?     ?)

there's only about a minute of peace before you realize that when something's gone something takes its place and it's not all the noise of the station that does, it's silence. Oppressive, overwhelming absence, SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, WHAT IS IT WHERE IS IT


So every spare moment, you prowl the blocks, hoping to hear a strain of the song that you can't forget you've forgotten.
