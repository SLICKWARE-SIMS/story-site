## Can't Stop Dancing!!

The DataStick crackles as a recording of a clearly terrified and exhausted young denizen is barely audible above a deep, rhythmic, and disturbingly entrancing bass.
I CANT. STOP. DANCING.
I met a man at Heaven. He wore a mask with a rictus grin and a perfectly tailored paisley suit. He told me he could bring me to where the real party was. A place where the dancing didn't end until the last heart stopped beating. So of course I followed him. The denizen pauses, you hear a thud in the background. A soft whimper. 
One more down. I followed him through dilapidated corridors. Too far. We ended up in the Choke, maybe. We stopped at a door with a mask identical to the denizen's painted on it. He opened it graciously and welcomed me inside. Inside were a few dozen other denizens. Looking around awkwardly, curious and confused. The grinning mask stepped into the center of the room and welcomed us all as partygoers. He raised his hands and started to dance. We all stared and looked around at each other, eyebrows raised questioningly. Then the lights dimmed, started strobing. And finally, the music started. The cursed music. Irresistible. Tantalizing. Fatal. The denizen grunts, letting out an unintelligible curse. Sorry. My legs. I bound them with my belt. BUT THEY STILL. WON'T. STOP. DANCING.
So we started dancing. Each movement, a part of one collective. We faded into the music. One writhing organism we became. Following the lead of the rictus mask, we danced. Hours passed, our throats became parched. Still we danced. It was not until the first of us passed out, eyes rolled back in their heads, their legs flapping below them wildly did we regain some of our selves. Horrified, dancers slowly returned from their reverie. Lips cracked, muscles spasming. Dancing their way to the door, screams of terror at the realization that there was none. Anywhere. A scream in the background, followed by a series of heavy thuds. I think someone just bashed their face into the floor.
Better than the denizen who broke their own legs. Makes dancing a lot more painful, broken legs. You know the worst part though. Not the lights, or that abominable music. No. It's still there. The one with the rictus mask, still dancing. They tried to catch him a while back, but he always slipped away. I can still see it when the lights flash, moving and skipping over the dead and writhing bodies. STOP! STOP DANCING! RRRAAAAGH. Heavy panting, the heavy thuds of bass. If you see it. The mask. Don't. JUST DON'T. I CAN'T ANYMORE. Screaming. If you find this... A long pause. I think I'll go try and drown myself in that pool of blood. Dragging sounds, some gurgling noises. The rest of the recording is a discordant bass, and occasionally, the barely perceptible sounds of lithely dancing footsteps.
