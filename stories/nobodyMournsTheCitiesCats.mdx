## Nobody Mourns The City's Cats

In a crisp white tunic, cape billowing out behind him, Bernard Quick walks briskly through Mid-town Prospero’s Dream. He pretends he belongs there. He scans the throngs of people in front of him, before throwing his gaze to the corners of the train terminal. The big boss nerd wants him to case all the train terminals in the Upper. Sure, Quick charges by the hour. His HUD pings the rough location of L net access points, CCTV, Tempest checkpoints, entrances to access tunnels. Don’t Hunglungs already have all this information already? He spots something in a showroom window that catches his eye… Prospero’s Dream couldn’t have a pet store, could it?

 “Terran Kittens and Puppies. Exotics, Beasts, and a Menagerie from Across the Rim”

           	He turns on a bootheel and opens the door. He walks the aisles. Looks into the eyes of an animal here and there. His scowl deepens. There’s fauna he recognizes, and some he doesn’t. He does what B. Quick always does, he makes himself invisible until he wants to be seen. Quick reads rooms. He reads situations. He reads people: Two employees, one an obvious manager. Distracted. The next Tempest patrol will pass this store in 20 minutes, there are no cameras pointed at this shop. This shop did not exist last week when he passed through here. The acoustics of train station, the sound of industrial work being done will mask anything but a continuous din.
 	“It’s genius right? We put the feed cats and puppies in the window, and hopefully a lower-middle class kid will scam their parents into buying one. They don’t know we sell them a dime a dozen to the rich Dream residents to feed their exotics. We’re making fucking bank, either way. Hey you sir, you don’t want those grubs. Gesturing to the traditional Earth animals. You look like a man of means. We could get you a miniature wyveryn, or say, a carnivorous purple worm. Those will impress the guys back at work eh?”
           	He's heard enough. Sorry about your “heat level” boss. B. Quick grins unsettlingly at the manager and his employee. His hand finds the shoulder holster strapped under the layers of his cape and tunic. The untraceable, unscannable, lightweight holdout pistol feels right when he draws it. 15 minutes later he’s walking away. The cages of the “Pet Store” are open, the back door left wide. On the Funicular back down to Doptown he looks into a bundle of his cape he holds in his arms, and two tiny terran kittens, a sickly orange cat and a black and white tuxedo cat swaddled inside. After he gets back into his mega-block apartment, he calls down to Loshe to find some canned fish. He looks out his window at the chaotic, wet, dark city he’s found himself in. “Aint nobody going to miss B. Quick when he’s gone little fellas. Would you? This “city” aint right, I tell ya. Nobody mourns the city’s cats.” Fin.
