## In the Eyes of The Press

Hiya readers! Most of my days were spent waking up in my office, on my murphy bed. In order to actually use my desk at all I'd have to push up my bed and pull out my chair. I would spend every morning with a glass of water, check what messages I've gotten on my datapad. If anything seemed important, at the time I was working for Tempest in secret specifically with Cabral as my sponsor, I would either contact Cabral to give the info to her or we would meet up and I'd give her my intel that way. She was often cold to me during these, wouldn't ever give me intel either, so anything Tempest do it felt like I was the last to know. Assuming I didn't need to meet with anyone, I would make my way to the bar that is now known as the Ember. My go to morning drink is a screwdriver lol! Hmm, I would spend a lot of time running ads in the market in hopes that people would give me intel for free! And they did, a lot. I would sometimes pay for it but I was able to actually get most of the faction's documents in my first or so week just by asking hahaha. Some people I did have to pay for intel but I would sometimes get refunded by Cabral. Anything that was actually put into the paper I would pick and choose myself. I did send it over to Cabral for approval, but as the comms grew slow and Cabral even more distant than she already was, I would just start putting them up without approval. I didn't really have friends at this point, just people who would try to trade intel with me. It was pretty lonely, actually. I had this spreadsheet, of people, what faction they were in, if I knew they were Bratva. I didn't really enjoy it. I should be clear, the point of the paper was to make friends and help prevent fighting, not gather intel, not isolate myself, but that is what it did.
During the next couple of weeks, I decided I would focus more on friendship. At the Bratva ball I became actual friends with Cabral, Tan, Tam, and Sterkman. They would be my first group of friends, but... they didn't last long. I still did my daily activies of writing Laux News and getting intel to Cabral but it felt like I could do more, only they wouldn't ever let me. I tried, I tried to get stories out that would help people. Later, I got an invite to Bratva, cold invite, no speaking. I did it because I was greedy but I was full of regret, I never event went to their HQ. Didn't use any of my intel from having access, I stuck to buying intel from those who would work with me. As the week went on, I became friends with Beef, Dutch, Millie, Lux, Angel, Joyce, and Tag. A lot of disagreements happened, Tan left, I've kicked Sterkman from our group chat. He is now back. Over time I became friends with Noa, Vox, and Heron and they are all in my friend's group chat where I don't allow work stuff hahaha! It was actually used during the rising choke that happened, strange to think about. At this point I somehow started going on dates with Beef, he was quite strange at first but he was very nice to me. First person to ever give me a gift in years, a small digital camera that I care with me everywere now. At that point I stopped actively looking for intel for Tempest. Mostly, I was distracted, but I wanted to be loyal so I kept trying to help Cabral when I could, of course, she was cold. This is an imperfect recount of things, and the timelines are a bit loose but I think it paints the picture.
After the hour long war, I got out of Bratva, but I also took the time to leave Tempest. I was upset with their actions. I couldn't believe that they thought a war would be the correct action. Everything I worked towards and desired, gone. The things Beef did for me, to help me... I wish he didn't do it for me. I worry about everyone, all of my friends, all of the denizens... My trust broke, I had to leave Tempest and urge my friends to leave, and yet, more of my friends just joined up, breaking my heart. I fear they will die for another war that shouldn't happen.

Now a days I just, have been interviewing those that I know. I've put a pause on Laux News for the time being. I don't know if it will come back, had a tarot reading for that actually and while it helped a lot, it has given me a lot to think about. I have spent a lot of time lately working on art for others, that has been enjoyable, I spend times with my friends, but I no longer feel I have a purpose. I strive to do more, helps others, but I don't know if that will happen. I am but a single woman, alone, scared. And yet, I still love this station and being here is the happiest I've ever felt. I will make a change. I think.
