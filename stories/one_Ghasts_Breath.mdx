Proceed
A True Fable
There once was a Kingdom so prosperous that everyone who lived there said it must be a dream. The Kingdom had many nobles, lords and bishops, but the greatest of their number was The King. The people of the Kingdom feared him, but they loved him as well. They said such noble things as “The King is so fucking cool. i wish i was as cool as The King.” and “Mr King knows what he’s doing I tell you what” and “Guys The King IS scary as fuck.” and so on and so forth.

But the King had grown old.He saw that his Kingdom lacked leadership. Its nobles, lords, and bishops squabbled over distractions. In time The King came to realize the Kingdom was a great burden to him. He had no one to pass the crown to and the ancient laws of his Kingdom forbade him from stepping aside from his burdens. So he set out to convince them to do it for him, to rise against him.

He squandered the kingdom’s treasury on steeds and the people said “If The King thinks it wise to spend money this way, it must be wise.” He kept wild vicious dogs and the people said, “The King needs to show his strength, so this must be wise.” He pushed his nobles and boyars to their limits and his nobles and boyars said again, “The King is so cool.” The King despaired that his people would ever realize his burdens were killing him. He surveyed his closest followers and found them wanting. He thought how he might show the Kingdom that they needed to rise to his challenge and become what The Kingdom needed.

But no one did this thing. No one raised their hand against The King. No one lifted their voices except to say, “I pray the king is fine.” There was no one who could hold their own against The King. His protege did not have the fire necessary to do what The King felt must be done. So The King began to despair. He turned from his people, who had failed him, to his past. He traveled to speak with a Wise Man in the gardens of paradise. The Wise Man and The King had known each other once before the Kingdom had been their burden, rather than their playground.

They spoke of faith, of The Kingdom, of the past, and the future. The King realized that since he had begun his mission he had forgotten the future even existed, so captivated was he by his own burden. He thought that the prosperous people of The Kingdom had failed him, but he had been failing them. He had not tested them thoroughly enough, had not yet roused them from their Dream. The Wise Man showed the King that if the people were not ready to lead themselves, he must make them ready, with blood and smoke and fire and a thousand thousand tests.

No one knows what happened to The Kingdom then. No one speaks of it anymore. Doubtless the place still exists, but the people have been scoured from its face. Their dreams are no more. Their hopes are no more. The King sought to make a successor - and in doing so he destroyed everything he hoped to protect.


Ghasts Breath

Do you know what oxygen starvation does to a man, tovarishch? Have you seen cyanosis, up close and personal? Red lips turned blue, steady breaths collapsing into futile gasps—desperate cries for that precious cocktail of gasses that gives us life?

Imagine it forever, tovarishch. Imagine the worst, last moment of your life, but the sweet release of death isn’t a *hope*—just a bitter memory. All that pain, that suffering, for nothing. No, worse than that—it’s the foundation on which they build your hell.

That’s what it is to be a ghast. That’s what it’s like to die down there, and never leave. It’s only our unluckiest that end of that way. Or, some say, our most deserving. Maybe that’s what I’ll be when I die. I don’t think so, though. I think anyone who dies up here goes out the vents, into the vacuum. Death is merciful. Final. There are no half-measures up here, tovarishch.

But down in The Choke…you’ve never seen a man suffocate, sure, but have you ever breathed half-ox? It’s worse than vacuum, I’ll tell you what. You *think* you can breathe it. It *tastes* like air. Feels like it, mostly. But it isn’t. Not really. It’s like biting into a nutrient block only to find a stale shell, hollow on the inside. It doesn’t fill you up. It doesn’t sate your hunger. It’s like sea water, tovarishch. It just makes you thirstier.

They’re no surprise then, ghasts. You wonder you don’t see ‘em more often. I don’t know how they do it, down there. How they breathe— Well, half-breath it every day, and still manage to die a person. It’s not human, living like that. Can’t be human dying like it either.

They say the Sink is full of ‘em. Me, I only saw one once. Floated right up out of the vent. Passed through it, like it was made of air. But I know it wasn’t. Couldn’t be. If it had air, tovarishch, it wouldn’t still be here. It wouldn’t be a ghast. It’d be gone. Hell, I think it was trying. Looking for the vacuum. Clawing to get free.

It’s sad, tovarishch. Hell of a way to go. Way to stay, really. Shouldn’t happen to anyone, I think. Some people believe it’s a punishment. It’s deserved. It’s what happens to the real criminals, the ones who didn’t just get behind on the ox-tax, but who really fucked someone up. Dish it out in life, take in death, eh? It’s a good story. But it’s not how the world works. Not how the Dream works, at least.

See, like I said before, I think they’re just unlucky. I think they made one bad decision, and ended up in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Got themselves tossed down, and died gasping, rasping, *clawing* for the upper decks. Never had to happen. So here’s the question, tovarishch. You gonna pay up? Or am I going to have to see if it happens to *you?*
