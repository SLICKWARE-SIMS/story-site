## One Ghast's Breath

Do you know what oxygen starvation does to a man, tovarishch? Have you seen cyanosis, up close and personal? Red lips turned blue, steady breaths collapsing into futile gasps—desperate cries for that precious cocktail of gasses that gives us life?

Imagine it forever, tovarishch. Imagine the worst, last moment of your life, but the sweet release of death isn’t a *hope*—just a bitter memory. All that pain, that suffering, for nothing. No, worse than that—it’s the foundation on which they build your hell.

That’s what it is to be a ghast. That’s what it’s like to die down there, and never leave. It’s only our unluckiest that end of that way. Or, some say, our most deserving. Maybe that’s what I’ll be when I die. I don’t think so, though. I think anyone who dies up here goes out the vents, into the vacuum. Death is merciful. Final. There are no half-measures up here, tovarishch.

But down in The Choke…you’ve never seen a man suffocate, sure, but have you ever breathed half-ox? It’s worse than vacuum, I’ll tell you what. You *think* you can breathe it. It *tastes* like air. Feels like it, mostly. But it isn’t. Not really. It’s like biting into a nutrient block only to find a stale shell, hollow on the inside. It doesn’t fill you up. It doesn’t sate your hunger. It’s like sea water, tovarishch. It just makes you thirstier.

They’re no surprise then, ghasts. You wonder you don’t see ‘em more often. I don’t know how they do it, down there. How they breathe— Well, half-breath it every day, and still manage to die a person. It’s not human, living like that. Can’t be human dying like it either.

They say the Sink is full of ‘em. Me, I only saw one once. Floated right up out of the vent. Passed through it, like it was made of air. But I know it wasn’t. Couldn’t be. If it had air, tovarishch, it wouldn’t still be here. It wouldn’t be a ghast. It’d be gone. Hell, I think it was trying. Looking for the vacuum. Clawing to get free.

It’s sad, tovarishch. Hell of a way to go. Way to stay, really. Shouldn’t happen to anyone, I think. Some people believe it’s a punishment. It’s deserved. It’s what happens to the real criminals, the ones who didn’t just get behind on the ox-tax, but who really fucked someone up. Dish it out in life, take in death, eh? It’s a good story. But it’s not how the world works. Not how the Dream works, at least.

See, like I said before, I think they’re just unlucky. I think they made one bad decision, and ended up in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Got themselves tossed down, and died gasping, rasping, *clawing* for the upper decks. Never had to happen. So here’s the question, tovarishch. You gonna pay up? Or am I going to have to see if it happens to *you?*
