## The Deliverer

Well. I’ve never told this story before. But I’ve never been offered 15kcr for just talking about the shit I’ve seen.

The Deliverer is real. The God of Mail is real and I’ve met them. They had my face.

So, Routine deliveries, running mail, making stops and taking names. Easy stuff, right? Yeah, it is easy, because I’m damn good at it. Varsity track athlete when I was younger and never lost that spring in my step. Made it easy to be the fastest source of connecting people aboard The Dream, where datapads and slickware couldn’t cut it.

Well being the best mail man on the Dream caught the attention of something out there.

The Deliverer. The God of Mail. The creator of the Courier’s Handbook. The ‘Deliverer of the First Message’ stuff isn’t some practical joke from the couriers before us. They are real and they saved my life.

I had to make a run to Tempest CO’s Armory. Simple delivery, some precious metals for the ‘smart’ components of their exos. Tempest was gearing up for a big expedition to a nearby asteroid cluster, and needed everything to be tip-top.

Hours after receiving the metals, I’m knee deep in crates of ammo and explosives being hauled around the armory, dodging giant exos and intimidating Tempest officers, just trying to complete my Delivery. MAA Dormand was the recipient, if I recall correctly. The Delivery went off without issue, creds in my wallet, and Tempest was happy.

Retracing my path through the armory is when all hell broke loose. Some ordnance shipment was still armed when it was getting transported. It cooked off and caused a huge explosion. Fire and smoke everywhere, alarms blaring, officers sprinting to provide order. I was just trying to survive the chaos.

There was a Tempest grunt in an exo, just trying to catch up to the others. I didn’t see him, and he definitely didn’t see me through the smoke. 

We both heard the crunch of my spine as he blew right through me at top speed. In an instant, everything went dark.

That’s when The Deliverer greeted me. They looked just like me, wore my clothes, wore my face, cargo rig and half-lit cig. All of it. At first, I was sure I had died, this was some guide into the afterlife, or something. But then The Deliverer spoke

“I/YOU/WE/ME are not done, DEAR/PERFECT/CHOSEN/COURIER, this is not the day you DIE/ARE DELIVERED”

I shot upright, waking to several Tempest guards standing around me. They were shocked I was even able to move, or that I was alive, for that matter. I wasn’t, The Deliverer saved my life, and they were wearing my face.

I was closely watched by medical staff for a while after that, but eventually I was cleared to move mail again.


I heard the grunt requested a transfer off-station not long after. He was honorably relieved of his duty, instead.
