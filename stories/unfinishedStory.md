A SIMULATION OF [INTRIGUE]

By dmgCTRL

---

A number of leads have led you to this part of the Dream as you search in hope for the elusive Black Market entrance. You know it is around here somewhere, but where?

You have gleaned a few pieces of info from various shady sources, but you don’t know how much is true.

You take a second to consider:

Not everyone is as they seem
Don’t eat the meat
The soup lady may have a tip for you
The porridge is pretty good, if you know what I mean?
Loyalty is above all else
Do not trust the old lady

With 50cr to your name you enter block [13,17]

---

1. START

You arrive in block [13,17] and are greeted by a cacophony of heavenly scents mixed with putrid odors. A number of hot food vendors line the bedraggled streets and a few catch your eye.

One woman sits on an upturned bucket emptying rusted cans smashed open by a hammer into a blackened pot. She smiles at you ‘Care for some surprise soup? Only cost ya a credit’.

Further up you see a shack made from wooden poles and a decaying canopy thick with black mold. Underneath, an encrusted sludge of some yeasty substance is stirred in an old bath tub by a man wearing a greasy red apron. He stops to mop his brow before continuing, but his sweat drips into the tub regardless. He quips his eyebrow catching your gaze ‘Don’t worry my friend, it only adds to the flavor, care for a sample?’. You must admit, it does smell nice.

Finally, you spot amidst the concrete rubble of a decayed shack a small shelter with a fire burning within. Over it a small rodent is being roasted by an old lady with bandages over her eyes. ‘I can’t see you but I can hear you, come in ‘ere and give Darryl some company, but the rat is mine you ‘ear!’

Who do you approach?

[2] Surprise soup
[3] Yeast man
[4] Darryl

2. SURPRISE SOUP

As you approach you notice the contents of the cans look surprisingly fresh and a distinctly meaty scent wafts towards you. The lady grabs her hammer and starts to smash the next can open, you notice several crushed fingers with the tip missing from one of them - perhaps it will truly be surprise soup.

What do you ask her?

[5] One bowl of soup please
[6] What happened to your fingers?
[7] What should I call you?

3. YEAST MAN

The man stops his stirring as you approach and chucks some rubbish onto the fire underneath the bathtub, the flames subside for a moment before roaring back to life with thick black smoke coming from underneath. An acrid cloud wafts towards you.

Do you

[29] Bravely step through the cloud, trying not to offend the man
[30] Dodge out the way back into the main street
[31] Take a deep breath staying where you are and wait for the fumes to pass

4. DARRYL
   As you approach the makeshift shelter, the old lady beckons you in. ‘Yes, yes, sit down, sit down. Come and speak to Darryl, for she will listen, and listen well. Can you hear it? Can you hear it?’ As you enter, the shelter appears warm and homely with many old sheets and clothes hung around acting as windbreaks.

Do you

[41] Try and take the skewered rat roasting on the fire
[42] Stop a moment and listen
[43] Offer [ITEM 64] to her (if you do not have this item then do not proceed)
[44] Pull down a sheet and throw it over her
[45] Pull down a sheet and throw it on the fire

5. ONE BOWL OF SOUP, PLEASE

The lady promptly puts down her hammer and scoops the soup with her hands into a small cardboard box that immediately starts to leak. ‘Don’t worry, the best bits will stay in, better eat it quick. 1cr if you please’

Do you

[8] Pay for the soup
[9] Grab the soup and run away
[10] Kindly decline the offer and walk away

6. SOUP’S FINGERS
   The soup lady looks at you for an agonizingly long time. Her gaze is piercing and starts to make you feel deeply uncomfortable.

Do you

[46] Look away in shame
[47] Stare back

7. SOUP’S NAME
   ‘Soup’ she says, ‘Just Soup, it’s all I’ve ever known. Now, don’t just stand there, order something or make way for other customers’

Do you

[5] Order some soup
[6] Ask about her fingers

8. PAY FOR THE SOUP

The lady accepts the payment and promptly hands you the cardboard box meal that is already starting to collapse.

Do you

[11] Tip the corner of the box to your lips and drink the soup
[12] inspect the soup
[13] Ask the lady if she has a spoon

9. STEAL THE SOUP
   Instead of handing over 1cr, you grab the dripping box from her and dash backwards. As practiced as you might expect, and unphased, she picks up a rusty can and, with perfect aim, pitches it towards you. It hits the box, causing it to explode all over you and smashes your fingers in the process. ‘Let that be a lesson to ye, now don’t come back!’

Do you

[21] Nurse your pride and return to the street
[52] Pick up the can
[50] Attack her

10. REJECT THE SOUP
    You think that the soup might be best avoided.

Do you

[21] Return to the street
[16] Demand a refund

11. DRINK THE SOUP

The hot contents flood your mouth. It is not unpleasant but there is something certainly wrong with the flavour, a mush of varying tones and textures. You bite down on something rubbery and grisly.

Do you

[14] Fish the gristle out
[15] Carry on and finish the soup

12. INSPECT THE SOUP
    On closer inspection, some of the chunks look suspect. Aghast, you see a fingernail poking out of a meaty bit and feel a wave of nausea come on.

Do you

[10] Reject the soup
[14] Remove the foreign object

13. DO YOU HAVE A SPOON
    You ask politely if she might have any cutlery. She starts to stare at you ‘What’s wrong? Yer hands not good enough?’.

Do you

[11] Drink it from the container
[54] Insist on a spoon
[55] Use your hands

14. FISH THE TIP OUT

Nearly vomiting, you pull the tip of a finger out. The woman nods and smiles knowingly.

Do you

[16] Demand a refund
[17] Give the finger back to the lady
[18] Eat the fingertip so as not to offend the lady
[19] Drop the fingertip on the ground in disgust
[20] Smile back and pocket the fingertip saying you want to save the best bits for later

15. FINISH THE SOUP
    Determined not to cause offence to the soup lady, you soldier on and despite repeated chewing, decide to swallow the gristley chunk whole, it goes down slowly, but finally your stomach settles and you give a pretend smile of thanks to her. She nods accordingly. Somewhat satisfied. ‘You weren’t meant to eat it but I appreciate the confidence’. She pulls up a small bag of similar fingertips and hands you another one. ‘Now, please don’t eat this, inspect it carefully’. Upon closer inspection you notice it to be a fake rubber fingertip. The fingerprint appears to be a circular code of some type. You take note and receive the FINGERTIP [ITEM 32] and return to the central area.

Go to [21]

16. DEMAND A REFUND

Utterly disgusted, you thrust the offending item back at the soup lady. Close to retching you ask firmly for your money back. She smiles a grin that says it all and taps a sign behind her that says ALL SALES FINAL. As she leaves you hanging, the cardboard box starts to lose its shape, and undergoes complete collapse. The warm contents splash onto your clothes and the ground. You hear a chittering chorus as multiple rays issue forth from the shadows fighting for the scraps. You see a large one scurry between your feet and pick up what looks to be a fingertip from the splatter.

Do you

[23] Grab the rat
[21] Flee in disgust

17. FINDERS KEEPERS

You kindly offer the lady back her finger tip, but she replies ‘Not to worry, finders keepers my dear’ as she closes your hand around the offending item. Whilst this happens the cardboard box starts to lose its shape, and undergoes complete collapse. The warm contents splash onto your clothes and the ground. You hear a chittering chorus as multiple rays issue forth from the shadows fighting for the scraps. You see a large one scurry between your feet and pick up what looks to be a fingertip from the splatter.

Do you

[23] Grab the rat
[21] Flee in disgust

18. MMMMMMM

Determined not to cause offence to the soup lady, you soldier on through the soup and thankfully don’t encounter any more surprises. She nods accordingly. Somewhat satisfied. ‘I appreciate the confidence in my food, so I will give you this’. She pulls up a small bag full of similar fingertips and hands you another one. ‘Now, please don’t lose this, inspect it carefully if you will’. Upon closer inspection you notice it to be a fake rubber fingertip. The fingerprint appears to be a circular code of some type. You take note and receive the FINGERTIP [ITEM 32] and return to the central area.

Go to [21]

19. DROP THE FINGERTIP
    You drop the fingertip in horror and it bounces unnaturally on the floor, in a flash, a large rodent races out of the shadows and snatches the fingertip mid bounce. You hear the soup lady’s sullen voice behind you. ‘Tis a shame, that was the best bit’.

Do you

[18] Finish the rest of the soup
[21] Chuck the repulsive meal into the rubbish at the side of the street and walk off in disgust

20. POCKET THE FINGERTIP

You are not sure why, but out of respect you put the fingertip in your pocket, slowly walking backwards as the cardboard finally disintegrates, spilling the remnants of the soup to the floor. A number of rats scurry forth oblivious of your presence and start eating the chunks chittering with delight.

Do you

[21] Move away quickly back to the center of the street
[22] Call over to Darryl, she might be interested in the rats
[23] Grab a rat

21. BACK TO THE STREET

You return to the main concourse of the street.You cast your eyes around and see the man stirring the yeast tub and a makeshift firelit shack.

Do you approach

[3] Yeast man
[4] Firelit shack

22. CALL TO DARRYL
    Sensing an opportunity to help someone keen on roasted rat out, you shout over to the blind woman. She leaps forth with unnatural swiftness and, tilting her head from side to side for just a second, focuses on the largest rat. She whirls a sling around her head and lets loose a stone that hits it square in the head. She meanders over at a more gentle pace, keenly dodging those in the street and picks up her prize.

She looks at you and then your pocket and reaches in to take out the fingertip. ‘You will want to look more closely at this my dear, do join me later if you can’. Upon closer inspection you notice it to be a fake rubber fingertip. The fingerprint appears to be a circular code of some type. You take note and receive the FINGERTIP [ITEM 32] and return to the central area.

Do you approach

[3] Yeast man
[4] Darryl

23. GRAB THE RAT

You bend down and try to grab a rat. It is so engrossed in gorging that it doesn’t even sense your presence.

Do you

[24] Pick it up with your bare hands, time is of the essence
[25] Use the remnants of the cardboard box to assist in the capture

24. GRAB THE RAT WITH BARE HANDS

The rat bucks and wriggles and as you wrestle with it it manages to take a chunk out of your arm with its razor sharp teeth. You reel in pain and drop the rat. It takes a second to find its bearings before making a decision and grabbing the fingertip over the chunk of your arm. The soup lady chuckles ‘Better luck next time, ha ha!’. She eyes the chunk with consideration and then looks you in the eye. ‘It would be a shame to waste it’ as she tilts her head towards the soup.

Do you

[21] Walk away in pain and disgust
[56] Humour her

25. CARDBOARD RAT CATCHER

Swiftly, you grab the soggy box and wrap the rat in it. It wriggles furiously but is contained.

Do you

[26] Offer the rat in tribute to the soup lady
[27] Stuff it in your bag, there isn’t much in there anyway
[28] Release it

26. RAT TRIBUTE

The soup lady appears genuinely touched at the gesture and gets up from her bucket and quickly stashes the squirming rodent underneath it before quickly sitting back down. You sense a certain rapport developing with her. ‘You might want to inspect that fingertip more closely’ she says with a knowing look. Upon closer inspection you notice it to be a fake rubber fingertip. The fingerprint appears to be a circular code of some type. You take note and receive the FINGERTIP [ITEM 32] and return to the central area.

Do you approach

[3] Yeast man
[4] Darryl

27. RAT IN A BAG

You stuff the soggy cardboard coated rat into your backpack and zip the thing up tight, tying some string around the zippers. You can feel it flipping around in there but after a while it loses energy. Perhaps it might be of some use? Receive the RAT [ITEM 8].

The soup lady nods to you, eyeing up the remnants of what is left on the floor. ‘Well, I hope you enjoyed it’. And looks back down, returning to her smashing.

Go to [21]

28. RELEASE THE RAT

Realising your madness, you let the thing scamper free before it bites you. The soup lady eyes you with caution. ‘Good meat that’ and looks back down returning to her labours.

Go to [21]

29. SMOKE CLOUD

As you step through the black cloud you can’t help but get some in your eyes. In response, you instinctively open your mouth and take in a deep lungful and begin spluttering and coughing. With eyes streaming and a deflated diaphragm, you stagger forward towards the yeast pot.

Another bout of coughing overwhelms you and out it comes over the yeast pot. The man smiles ‘Yes, yes, add to the flavour!’.

After you finally stop coughing and wiping your streaming eyes he says ‘A good coating of porridge will work wonders on those eyes, or perhaps a batch of brew for the throat? Consider it a sample’

Do you

[32] Accept a sample of porridge for your eyes?
[33] Drink the dark colored liquid he offers
[34] Upturn the abhorrent yeast mixture onto the fire to protect anyone else walking down the alley

30. DODGE SMOKE

You dive backwards, out of the way of the cloying cloud, and into the street. Off balance, you stumble madly and fall down into the middle of the street where you lay for a second. With scrapes and cuts all over your hands, you start to wonder why you came to this part of town. Dishevelled, you pick yourself up and dust yourself down. And get your bearings. The smoke appears to have died down now.

Do you

[57] Return to the Yeast brewer
[4] Think better of it and go and speak to Darryl

31. HOLD BREATH
    You quickly close your mouth and eyes and wait a few seconds for the smoke to pass. As you reopen them you can see the Yeast brewer smiling at you shaking a tumbler of black liquid. ‘Not intentional, I assure you. Let me say sorry with a free sample’.

Do you

[33] Accept the black liquid
[58] Enquire about the nature of the porridge
[4] Go and speak to Darryl instead

32. EYE PORRIDGE

You reach out desperately and smear the substance over your burning eyes, immediate relief floods your eyes and as you blink through the mess you see the man heartily chuckling to himself. He leans forward ‘Let me get that for you’ and wipes a chunk, about to drip down, with his thumb and eats it. He appears to go into a trance of ecstasy for a brief moment before his eyes return to normal. You start to notice that the glow from the fire has intensified significantly and the man himself and the porridge pot give off a faint glow.

Do you

[33] Ask for some brew
[35] Eat the porridge
[62] Walk briskly away

33. BLACK LIQUID

You look at the cup of warm dark liquid, it has a foisty smell on it. The man grins and grabs a glass for himself. ‘Join me?’.

Do you

[59] Down it in one
[60] Enquire as to the nature of the black liquid

34. FIRE FIGHTER

You step forward and heroically grab hold of the tub. It is hot to the touch but you don’t care and as the searing porcelain burns your hands you up-end the tub in a feat of strength into the fire. The thick yeast slops out and spits and crackles as it hits the fire, an amazing scent fills your nostrils, and as your eyes turn up in your head you feel pure ecstasy as you lose consciousness as you hear the words faintly ‘Yes, breath it in my friend’.

Go to [53]

35. YEAST PORRIDGE

You decide to try the porridge hoping to enjoy it as much as the man. The taste is sublime, it is salty, thick and creamy but with a sourness to it. The chunks melt quickly in your mouth and you find your eyes upturning in a fit of ecstasy. You really want some more.

Do you

[36] Give in to the urges and ask for more porridge
[37] Resist the urges

36. PLEASE SIR, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE?

‘Why of course you can. The second helping is 20cr. There is always more’

Do you

[61] Buy some more porridge for 20cr
[37] Resist the urges again

37. RESIST TEMPTATION

The man sees you struggling. ‘Alas, I know all too well the temptations of the porridge, it is futile to resist, but the Brew I serve can help calm the cravings. You may purchase a bottle for only 20cr, or give in to the porridge, which also happens to be 20cr’

Do you

[61] Buy the Brew or the porridge from him for 20cr
[38] Firmly decline the offer

38. NO THANKS

You look him in the eyes and with a struggle you manage to get a hold of yourself and decline his offer. He shakes his head muttering that there is no loyalty here.

Go to [62]

39. HANDS IN THE YEAST
    You thrust your hands and arms into the warm yeasty porridge without a second’s hesitation. A burning sensation starts around your wounds but slowly the pain subsides and a pleasant sense of calm comes over you. Smiling, you slowly withdraw your arms from the substance and with a sucking noise they come free. You look around for a towel but see no such item. Looking towards the man he offers no such respite either. ‘You must leave it on to dry to a crust and your wounds will be healed tomorrow’ he says with the voice and confidence of a sage.

Do you

[40] Quickly wipe off the disgusting mixture onto your clothes
[63] Leave it on as he says and thank him for his assistance

40. CLEAN
    You laboriously wipe your arms clean amidst a crowd of bewildered onlookers. Most of it comes off and smears over your clothes, but the parts around your wounds have significantly hardened and won’t come off easily.

Do you

[64] Leave them where they are
[65] Pull them off with force

41. DARRYL’S RAT

42. LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS

43. DARRYL OFFERING

44. DARRYL SHEET

45. SHEET FIRE

46. LOOK AWAY
    ‘That’s what I thought, now leave me in peace’

Do you

[21] Return to the street
[48] Refuse to leave, demanding soup

47. STARE

You both intensely stare at each other. 30 seconds pass with neither of you backing down. She finally breaks ‘I’ll show you if you want!’ and flings her hammer at you. It narrowly misses your head clipping your ear, and clinks off down the street.

Do you

[49] Run after the hammer and pick it up
[50] Attack her

48. I WANT SOUP!

You stand there defiantly, standing your ground, and ask firmly for some soup. She picks up her hammer and points it at you. ‘For you a special price of 10cr’.

Do you

[21] Leave her be and return to the street
[51] Pay 10cr for the soup

49. HAMMER TIME

You quickly run away and pick up the hammer from the floor, before darting behind some other stalls. You now have the HAMMER [ITEM 128]

Go to [21]

50. OH NO YOU DON’T
    You launch yourself at the soup lady, but as you grasp her shoulders, you quickly feel the chiseled muscles from years of hammering. Like a rock, she deflects you effortlessly into the wall, and everything goes dark.

Go to [53]

51. EXPENSIVE SOUP

The lady promptly puts down her hammer, smiles unnervingly, and scoops the soup with her hands into a small cardboard box that immediately starts to leak. ‘I hope you don’t choke. 10cr’

Do you

[8] Pay 10cr for the soup
[9] Grab the soup and run away
[10] Kindly decline the offer and walk away

52. CAN
    You quickly run away from the soup lady and pick up the dented can as you go. You now have the DENTED CAN [ITEM 2].

Go to [21]

53. WAKE UP

You find yourself coming to, covered in all manner of injuries. You are in an unlit side street off the main thoroughfare. You are stripped of your possessions and have nothing left.

Your SIMULATION ends here

YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED THIS TIME IN FINDING THE ELUSIVE BLACK MARKET, BUT PERHAPS YOU LEARNED A FEW THINGS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO JACK BACK?

[Y/N]

54. I WILL HAVE MY SPOON!
    Whilst you insist on using cutlery like a civilised person, the cardboard box starts to lose its shape, and undergoes complete collapse. The warm contents splash onto your clothes and the ground. You hear a chittering chorus as multiple rays issue forth from the shadows fighting for the scraps. You see a large one scurry between your feet and pick up what looks to be a fingertip from the splatter.

Do you

[23] Grab the rat
[21] Flee in disgust

55. HANDS ON

You use your hands in a similar way to how the soup lady did, thinking that you may as well do as the locals do to blend in. You scoop the soup up in cup-like motions with one hand and it is surprisingly effective. You enjoy the soup and get halfway through it, when you notice in one handful a severed fingertip poking out.

Do you

[15] Eat the fingertip and finish the soup
[17] Give the fingertip to the lady
[19] Drop the fingertip out of your hand and onto the floor

56. CHUNK

The soup lady graciously accepts the chunk but gives a wry smile of understanding. ‘I’ll dispose of that for you and bandage you up. But I appreciate your faith in me. For that a little something extra’.

The soup lady pulls out a nice clean first aid kit and sterilises her hand with a hidden bottle of alcohol that she gets from under the bucket. After seeing to your wound in a gentle manner, she reaches once again under the bucket and pulls out a bag of finger tips and hands one to you. ‘Don’t worry, they aren’t real, made of rubber, but take a good look’.

Upon closer inspection you notice it to be a fake rubber fingertip. The fingerprint appears to be a circular code of some type. You take note and receive the FINGERTIP [ITEM 32] and return to the central area.

Go to [21]

57. ADDS TO THE FLAVOUR

The man eyes up your scapes and cuts and encourages you back over, ‘Do not waste the flavour my friend, put them in, put them in, the Yeast will heal your wounds’.

Do you

[39] Put your hands into the Yeast
[62] Think better of it and return to to the street to nurse your wounds

58. THE NATURE OF PORRIDGE

‘I know not what it is. It seems to take on a life of its own and its properties change daily. It is very moreish though, it has a firmness to its chunks. A firm favourite around here though. Please accept the offering. It is delicious!’ he says as his eyes roll back in his head at the ecstasy he clearly experiences.

Do you

[35] Accept the offering
[62] Leave quickly

59. DOWN THE HATCH
    A deeply salty flavour, that has elements of mold, pours down your throat and you notice the thoughts of porridge start to subside. ‘Now, shall I put you down for two more bottles tomorrow?’ The man asks, ‘Or perhaps more porridge?’. He gets out his notebook. ‘We have a 2 for 1 special tomorrow if you pay now. How about it?’.

You feel uneasy about the situation

Do you

[61] Buy two more bottles of brew or porridge for 20cr to be picked up tomorrow
[38] Politely decline the offer now you have your wits about you

60. THE NATURE OF THE BREW

The man points up to the sagging canopy above and you notice a black liquid dripping through it and into a container on the floor behind the bath tub. ‘Mother nature’s best’ he says. ‘As to what it is exactly, I cannot say. Now are you going to drink it or not?’.

Do you

[38] Reject the liquid
[59] Drink it regardless

61. LOYALTY
    ‘Thank you for your custom, you can pick it up tomorrow morning when the batch is fresh. Now that you are a repeat customer please accept this loyalty card’. Please add LOYALTY CARD [ITEM 4] to your inventory. You see 9 stamp locations with 2 already marked. But a strange sequence of text is underneath.

TIPX UIJT UP EBSSZM

62. BACK TO THE STREET AGAIN

You return to the main concourse of the street.You cast your eyes around and see the soup lady smashing cans and a makeshift firelit shack.
