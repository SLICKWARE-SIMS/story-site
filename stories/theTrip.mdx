## The Trip

It was a cold morning when I found myself stirred awake while on route to the Dream. I cannot describe what it was that woke me beyond an odd feeling deep below my ribs. As I sat there the feeling grew until I could no longer bear to remain in my bed. I set off, in hopes of finding relief, down the corridors of the ship. It must have been two or three hours that I wondered because when I finally neared my first window since leaving my room the light from an approaching star began to fill the room. There was no warmth of course but as the light graced my face I could not help but feel somewhat soothed. I decided to sit in that light a bit. Space was still new to me, I had not learned to live with depths. The white lights of the ship did nothing to soothe the sense of enclosing darkness from without. The feeling of isolation gnawed at me from within. When the star finally passed out of sight I was left more anxious than before as the darkness gripped me again. For the next few weeks I hardly slept. My eyes sagged, my bones began to peak through ever paler skin. I thought with certainty that my sanity would leave me before reaching The Dream, that my hopes of a new life would be dashed in this darkness. I thought rather than go mad I may as well die peacefully. I took to the deck again, resolved to die at least in the twinkling light of the stars. As I stood there meaning my end a sudden yellow light approached my ship. From the darkness she came, that great white creature glowing with a divine light. Unlike the star her light brought true warmth. Tears flooded my eyes as her tail flipped and fluttered near me. Her deep bellowing sang to soothe my soul. Her grace was astounding and in that moment I knew I had to live to speak of her, to help to share with another even the slightest memory of her light. She stayed with me, that beautiful creature. For the next few months I hardly left my windows. We danced together and sang and her light rekindled the one that had been lost in me. I grew stronger, encouraged to eat just to stay in her company. As I neared the Dream I began to know somehow that the time would come for her to part from me but I no longer grieved the knowledge that she would leave. And when the time did come for her to part, unlike with the star, my anxiety did not return. She gave me a resolve I had never known. I will be forever grateful of the time and companionship she gave me. I hope again to see her light again while waking, but here on the Dream she will always be alive in my dreams if nothing else.
