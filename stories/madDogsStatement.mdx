## Mad Dog's Statement

Had this gig. Testing an experimental sensor package for a ship I later learned would be named after Heimdall's horse. Very hush - almost a black box. I don't usually go for high-security crap like that. But you know what the dead guy said: my poverty, but not my will.

So we're testing this long-range imaging rig as it dangles off the orbital platform where it's being fabricated. It's an optical - got some nanomaterial lens or something - so we're testing its range and resolution against a relay of scout drones. It's pointed at deep space, no known heat sources or big cosmic features close enough to interfere.

And it's long shifts, one after another, and the guy before me loses it so I pull a double. And I'm already on too many drugs: not just the uppers to stay awake or the antidepressants so staring into darkness doesn't make me want to kill myself, but some other stuff for my own reasons. And the money's been too good to be true so I've been waiting for something to go all fucked, again.

I'm watching the scope, staring at nothing, 6:18 left in a 12-hour shift, when it moves. The darkness, the nothing, shifting to curl a little bit tighter around a distant star. Figure I’m hallucinating and check the readings. The differences in light intensity values are small, but real. And I get this feel like, if a star can get a little darker while I fucking watch, then how faster must that be happening in cosmic terms? Somebody who studies these things should know.

I open the video link with the science liaison at corporate headquarters and first I can see her: the too-bright enhanced contacts, gunmetal gray coat, glint of some barely visible necklace. Then in these weird twists, like spirals, it goes black and her voice flattens out into one low bass tone, all glitchy but slow, and for some reason I can't stand it and shut the whole system off. Open up the text interface to type some kind of summary of what I think I'm seeing. Goes dark, too. My screen actually cracks.

And there in the lines of the breaking glass, I see it:

silence, fool.

So I quit that job and started drinking pretty hard and it took me a while to stop and then I ended up here.
