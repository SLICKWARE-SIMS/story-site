## A True Fable

There once was a Kingdom so prosperous that everyone who lived there said it must be a dream. The Kingdom had many nobles, lords and bishops, but the greatest of their number was The King. The people of the Kingdom feared him, but they loved him as well. They said such noble things as “The King is so fucking cool. i wish i was as cool as The King.” and “Mr King knows what he’s doing I tell you what” and “Guys The King IS scary as fuck.” and so on and so forth.

But the King had grown old.He saw that his Kingdom lacked leadership. Its nobles, lords, and bishops squabbled over distractions. In time The King came to realize the Kingdom was a great burden to him. He had no one to pass the crown to and the ancient laws of his Kingdom forbade him from stepping aside from his burdens. So he set out to convince them to do it for him, to rise against him.

He squandered the kingdom’s treasury on steeds and the people said “If The King thinks it wise to spend money this way, it must be wise.” He kept wild vicious dogs and the people said, “The King needs to show his strength, so this must be wise.” He pushed his nobles and boyars to their limits and his nobles and boyars said again, “The King is so cool.” The King despaired that his people would ever realize his burdens were killing him. He surveyed his closest followers and found them wanting. He thought how he might show the Kingdom that they needed to rise to his challenge and become what The Kingdom needed.

But no one did this thing. No one raised their hand against The King. No one lifted their voices except to say, “I pray the king is fine.” There was no one who could hold their own against The King. His protege did not have the fire necessary to do what The King felt must be done. So The King began to despair. He turned from his people, who had failed him, to his past. He traveled to speak with a Wise Man in the gardens of paradise. The Wise Man and The King had known each other once before the Kingdom had been their burden, rather than their playground. 

They spoke of faith, of The Kingdom, of the past, and the future. The King realized that since he had begun his mission he had forgotten the future even existed, so captivated was he by his own burden. He thought that the prosperous people of The Kingdom had failed him, but he had been failing them. He had not tested them thoroughly enough, had not yet roused them from their Dream. The Wise Man showed the King that if the people were not ready to lead themselves, he must make them ready, with blood and smoke and fire and a thousand thousand tests. 

No one knows what happened to The Kingdom then. No one speaks of it anymore. Doubtless the place still exists, but the people have been scoured from its face. Their dreams are no more. Their hopes are no more. The King sought to make a successor - and in doing so he destroyed everything he hoped to protect.
