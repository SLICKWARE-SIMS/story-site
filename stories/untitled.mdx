With closed eyes, the brightness of the sun peered through his eyelids. He could feel the radiating warm sunlight on his face. But it wasn't his sun, unfamiliar and foreign, this was the star of another system far from home. Opening his eyes, he could see that this was a sickening sun, with foul flares bursting. They were given extra doses of preventive antirad and had all electronic system enclosures reinforced. The radiation was still interfering with both the flesh and circuitry.

He felt an unease in his gut, not sure whether it was the radiation, the antirad med, or a gut feeling. It should have been just another mission. If it wasn't another bug hunt, it was insurrection quelling. The mission brief was standard fare, cookie-cutter: find the insurrectionists, deal with them, then return to base.

Simple. Simple. It wasn't, far from it.

He should have noticed it. The higher-ups were nervous, and the unusual other-colonial-agency mission attaché was more unusual than the usual ones.

The shuttle shook and rumbled as it was approaching atmospheric entry. The shutter-shields curtained down, plunging the troop bay into darkness. Some of the troops were chatting among themselves.

With a shove to his shoulder, the marine next to him said:
"Living the dream, another day in the Colonial Corps! Right, Kōltarius?"

"We're on the job, Sergeant Jannus."

"Apologies, sir. Lieutenant Féinloch."

Lt. Kōltarius Féinloch, still feeling unease even after the sickening light was walled away, tried to exchange cheerful banter with his friend, Sergeant Vilhelm Jannus.

"Fuck you too, Vilhelm."

"Likewise, sir. Hoorah!"
 
Kōltarius chuckled.

Across from them sat the OGA attaché, who was augmented and carrying a demeanor that clearly stated 'don't fuck with me, fuck away'. Her cybernetic eyes flashed briefly. A moment later, the shuttle took an abrupt turn.

Over the shuttle intercom, the pilot said:
"New mission parameter received, rerouting course to new objective. It'll be a hotter LZ, boys, girls, and people."

The shuttle growled as it violently adjusted its flight path during atmo-entry.

At one end of the bay, a young marine yelled out:
"Hey OCA Lady, what the frak is going on? Mind telling us what you're throwing us into?"

"No. Do your job."

The bay came to an awkward silence, as the chatter stopped. Only to be broken by the loud motto exclaimed by one of the heavy-gunner:
"If we ain't dying, we killing."

The other marines replied in unison:
"Blood for the Blood Battalion. Hoorah!"

They were approaching their destination. The shuttle opened its deployment ramp. The ill-blinding light assaulted Kōltarius's eyes. It started. And, in flashes, it ended.

He came to, not remembering but hazy blurs of what happened. His arm was in excruciating pain; it was mangled, with two fingers barely hanging loosely by strands of sinew. He couldn't feel his legs. As he looked down, he saw both of them with tourniquets, his left leg completely missing below his knee.

He was being dragged. By something. Blacking out.
